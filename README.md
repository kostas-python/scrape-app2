This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Puppeteer, and ShadCN/UI, this web scraping application efficiently extracts structured business data while bypassing bot detection using the Stealth plugin. It supports multi-page navigation, dynamically follows pagination, and ensures robust error handling to prevent crashes or data loss.

The scraper extracts key details such as business name, address, occupation, email, website, and phone number from multiple listing formats, normalizing the data for consistency. The extracted data is processed, structured, and exported as a CSV file, ensuring compatibility with various data analysis tools.

The UI, built with ShadCN/UI and Tailwind CSS, provides a clean and responsive interface for managing scraping tasks. API routes in Next.js handle requests efficiently, leveraging serverless functions for optimized performance. The application is deployed on Vercel for scalability and fast global access.

This project demonstrates expertise in web automation, data extraction, API development, UI/UX design, and cloud deployment, showcasing the ability to build efficient, scalable, and user-friendly web applications.
